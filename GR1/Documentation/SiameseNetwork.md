# Bioactivity with SiameseNetwork

# Old approach:
1. IterRefLSTM:
- Representatation: graph
- Refined LSTM for one-shot learning

2. Torres:
- SMILES with one-hot encoding
- SNN with one-shot learning

3. SiameseCHEM:
- Task-specific fingerprinting
- SNN/ n-shot learning

4. Vella et al.
- Prototypical network/ few-shot learning


# Approach
- Works like an embedding with a GCN/ GCN and Attentive FP:
+ 2D
